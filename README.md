## About

This is an example React app to demo [100ms' React SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@100mslive/hms-video-react).

Not using React? Find the [Javascript Quickstart here](https://docs.100ms.live/javascript/v2/guides/javascript-quickstart).

## Prerequisites

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version v12.13.0 or greater installed on your system.

## Clone the repo

Get the code by cloning this repo using git.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:100mslive/100ms-web-v2.git
```

Once cloned, open the terminal in the project directory, and install dependencies with:

```bash
cd 100ms-web-v2
yarn install
```

Create a new file `.env` and copy the values from `example.env`

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

### Get the token generation endpoint

Get your token endpoint from the [Developer section of 100ms' Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/developer)

Update the `REACT_APP_TOKEN_GENERATION_ENDPOINT` in `.env` file with the above token endpoint value (eg. `https://prod-in.100ms.live/hmsapi/example.app.100ms.live/`)

### Run the app
Then start the app with:

```bash
yarn start
```

The app now should be running at https://localhost:3000/. (Please ignore the 404 message, you need to join the right URL of the room. Next sections describe how to create a room and form the correct URL)

### Create a room

Create room from [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/create-room) & get the room_id & role of the created room. Room details page after creating the room gives you room_id and roles allowed in the room.

### Join the room

*Before running the app locally make sure you update the environment file (.env) with the respective REACT_APP_TOKEN_GENERATION_ENDPOINT and REACT_APP_POLICY_CONFIG to avoid parsing error*

Visit the URL : https://localhost:3000/meeting/<room_id>/< role > to join the room

Use any name & Click on join.

## Additional Flags(present in .env file)

### Configure UI layout

Depending on the value of REACT_APP_POLICY_CONFIG in .env, you can customize which roles should be displayed in center stage and which roles should be display in side pane.

The value of REACT_APP_POLICY_CONFIG should be a JSON stringified object of the structure:

```ts
type HMSRoleName = string;

/**
 * undefined means none
 * empty array [] for all roles
 */
interface RoleConfig {
  center?: HMSRoleName[];
  sidepane?: HMSRoleName[];
  selfRoleChangeTo?: HMSRoleName[];
  remoteRoleChangeFor?: HMSRoleName[];
}

interface PolicyConfig {
  [role: string]: RoleConfig;
}
```

Example: `REACT_APP_POLICY_CONFIG = "{"trainer":{"center": ["student"],"sidepane":["trainer"]}}"`

It is used in the app as:

```js
const envPolicyConfig = JSON.parse(process.env.REACT_APP_POLICY_CONFIG || "{}");
```

### Tile Aspect Ratio

REACT_APP_TILE_SHAPE can be used for this, the format is `width-height` e.g.
`1-1` for square tiles, `4-3` for landscape tiles and `16-9` for wide tiles.

### Env - REACT_APP_THEME
`dark` - for dark theme
`light` - for light theme

### Env - REACT_APP_COLOR
You can give a hex code the color will be used fo buttons, border audio level and such.

### Playlist Tracks(Watch Party)

This is a way to play any music or any videos from a url for everyone in the room to see/vibe to together. The support
is only for file formats which are supported by the native audio and video elements, but it's super cool.

`REACT_APP_AUDIO_PLAYLIST` - a list of audio tracks which can be played by a person in the room for everyone
`REACT_APP_VIDEO_PLAYLIST` - a list of video tracks which can be played by a person in the room for everyone
